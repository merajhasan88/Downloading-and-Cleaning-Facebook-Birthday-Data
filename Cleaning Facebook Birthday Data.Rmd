**reading own facebook birthdays data from a file downloaded from google calendar and duly converted to csv format within excel
  bdays <- read.csv('bdays.csv')

**removing the first few rows of unwanted data
  
  bdays <- bdays[33:647,]
  
**since the required birth dates of friend contacts lies after every 15 rows we need to access only those rows and not the rest. So we generate the indices first  
  newvar <- seq(1,615,by=15)
  
**accessing only the required rows  
  bdays <- bdays[(newvar)]
  
**looking at the data we see that from the birthdate the month and day can be easily extracted as data from 24th to 27th character  
  mday <-substring(bdays,24,25)
  days <-substring(bdays,26,27)
  
**to be analyzed however the data needs to eb converted from chr data type to num  
  mday <- as.numeric(mday)
  days <- as.numeric(days)
  
**have fun!
